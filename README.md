# Web-based Stock Price Prediction Application Using Machine Learning
A web-based stock price prediction application built using Flask and Machine Learning models to forecast future stock prices of Malaysian banking sector companies. The app provides users with real-time prediction capabilities using historical financial data and ML algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

# 🔧 Features
- 🏦 Sector selection: Choose between 5 stocks from 20 sectors
- 🧠 ML Models: Select from RF, SVR, or ANN for prediction
- 📊 Evaluate model performance (MSE, MAE, R²)
- ⏱ Predict future stock prices based on selected timeframes
- 📈 Interactive graphs for historical vs predicted prices

# 🛠 Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Chart.js
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Data: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)
- Others: Pandas, NumPy, MinMaxScaler

# How to Run The App
1. You can choose either download the file or clone the repository using:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-app.git
